# Nabla TypeMath

Nabla TypeMath is an android application that allow you to easily type mathematical symbols.

## How to use it?

Write in any text box, in the form of `<initString><Commands><endString>` and then press `spacebar` to convert the commands into unicode symbols.

For example, by default `<initString>` and `<endString>` So you can write `.x^2 + alpha ^2.` , press `spacebar` and the text will be converted into `x² + α²`

## What are the commands?

Most of the commands are similar to LaTeX commands, for example `int`, `in`, `partial`, `nabla` will all be converted into `∫` , `∈` , `∂` , and `∇` respectively.

More information about the commands is available in the app.
